  <h1> Hello Icecream! </h1> 
  <p> Hi. I'm a science panda. I like to eat bamboo and when I am evil I don't eat humans.</p>
  <p>Did you know that sound only travels in straight lines although when it travels from one medium to another it will change direction
    and that's called refraction.</p>
  <p>Also, white light is  made up of all the colours of the rainbow. When we look at a           white car, for example, it reflects all colours 
  so it looks white. However if you look at a black car it will absorb all the colours so it looks black.</p>
